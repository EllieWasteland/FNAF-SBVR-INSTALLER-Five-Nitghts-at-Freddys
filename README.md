FNAF: SBVR is a virtual reality mod for *Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach* that completely transforms the base game experience by introducing full 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) movement and native compatibility with the OpenXR standard for headsets like Meta Quest and SteamVR. Designed exclusively for Windows environments, this mod safely injects into the original game, allowing players to walk and survive in the Mega Pizzaplex with unprecedented immersion, all managed through an intuitive installer and a dedicated *launcher*.

## Mod Features
* **Full 6DOF Movement:** Total freedom to move, lean, and explore the environment in 3D space.
* **OpenXR Compatibility:** Works natively with the vast majority of modern headsets (Oculus, etc.).
* **Windows Exclusive:** Specifically optimized for the operating system where the base game runs.
* **Dedicated Launcher:** Creates a shortcut that correctly initializes the virtual reality mode, separate from the normal Steam execution.

## Download and Installation
The automated installer (`SBVR_Installer.exe`) is available in the **[Releases](../../releases)** section of this repository. 

**Quick Steps:**
1. Download the latest version from the *Releases* tab.
2. Run the file (it will ask for Administrator permissions to apply the necessary patches).
3. Select your original game folder (default is `steamapps/common/Five Nights at Freddys Security Breach`).
4. **Important!** ALWAYS start the game using the new VR Launcher created on your desktop to activate virtual reality.

## Credits
This project is made possible by the hard work of the VR developer community:
* **MagaBG:** For the configuration and fine-tuning of the movement profiles.
* **UEVR:** For providing the powerful base virtual reality injection engine.
